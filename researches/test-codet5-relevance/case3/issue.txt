ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Steps to reproduce the bug :

    Enter any number as the first operand

    Press the division button

    Enter zero as the second operand.

This can be fixed by a **try and catch ** block .

    I would also like to add a button to calculate the powers of numbers .
    For doing this I plan to change the UI a little i.e. just restrict the '0' button to a single column so that 'power' button can be accommodated in the next column
